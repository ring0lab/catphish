## Docker

You can also run the tool with Docker! This lets you try it out without any of the required dependencies (ruby), except
Docker itself. This presumes that you have the docker daemon installed. If not, see
[Docker's documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).

First, build the container

```
$ cd path/to/repository

# Generate a tag so we know how to find the container later to run it. You can use anything (latest is common);
# here the git hash is used.
$ TAG=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)

# Run the build
$ docker build --tag "catphish:${TAG}" .

# Eventually docker will print something like:
#
#   Successfully built 8f0b8bfe0c41
#   Successfully tagged catphish:f947517

```

Perfect! Now, you can execute catphish via Docker:

```
$ docker run \
    --rm=true \
    "catphish:${TAG}" \
        --Domain ring0labs.com \
        generate --All
```
